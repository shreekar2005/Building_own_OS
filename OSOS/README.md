# OSOS
This is actual OSOS from scratch ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Here I am writing 32bit kernel in c++ and kernel loader in x86_64 (not bootloader, I will use grub as bootloader)

### I am using Ubuntu24.04 to develop OSOS
## Requirements 
### 1. Install reqrired tools
`bash
sudo apt-get install g++ binutils libc6-dev-i386 g++-multilib make qemu-system-x86 mtools xorriso grub-pc-bin
` 
### 2. GCC cross-compiler (i686-elf-TOOL)
Follow the Instructions in ../cross-compiler and `make your own cross-compiler`. You will need cross-compiler due to some reasons that you will find in cross-compiler README.

#### If you dont want to make cross-compiler (which is not good idea) then you can go to this commit `f500e99459b3d1cf9e592b4be19fe4e2706ef2db` and follow current project and check whether you can build OSOS without cross compiler üôÇ

## Steps to run OSOS
### To boot from binary
1. `make bin` (to build project)
2. `qemu-system-i386 -kernel ./build/mykernel.bin `
3. Combined :
    ```bash
    make bin && qemu-system-i386 -kernel ./build/mykernel.bin
    ```

### To boot from iso
1. `make iso` (to build project)
2. `qemu-system-i386 -cdrom build/mykernel.iso`
3. Combined :
    ```bash
    make iso && qemu-system-i386 -cdrom build/mykernel.iso
    ```

### To boot from VirtualBox
1. `make iso`
2. Create new machine, named as "My Operating System" in VirtualBox using iso file made in build/mykernel.iso (This is one time step)
3. KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) have control on VT-x, So to give VT-x to VirualBox we have to remove KVM <br>
    `sudo modprobe -r kvm_intel; sudo modprobe -r kvm # for intel processors`
4. `make run`
5. After running you may turn on KVM module again <br>
    `sudo modprobe kvm_intel; sudo modprobe kvm`
6. Combined : (Dont forgot step2, step3 and step 5!!!)
    ```bash
    make run
    ```

## What things are implemented in OSOS:
1. Custom printf utility (checkout ./utils_32bit/console.c)
2. Can use multiboot_info provided by grub bootloader
3. Calling global object constructors and destructors which are listed in `.init_array` and `.fini_array` sections (i am listing them in `.ctors_dtors` section created by linker script)
4. Can use keyboard `input` (typing on screen) by Polling method. (Without Interrupt Service)

## Learnings or some extra :
### 1. Using `extern "C"` in C++ :
1. To prevent "name mangling" or "name decoration" (compiler modifies name of function or variable for some use cases).
2. Use `extern "C"` if that function or variable is used by some program which is outside of current C++ file. e.g kernMain, callConstructors, clearScreen
### 2. `callConstructors` function :
1. This function is to call constructor of global instances (constructor for local instance is called without any problem but for global instance we need this special function)
### 3.  `readelf` and `objdump` : Tools to examine binaries
1. Use readelf for understanding the ELF file structure and how it loads into memory. 
2. Use objdump for disassembling code and general-purpose inspection.
### 4. also using `ghidra` for examine binaries (reverse engg) :
1. Go to Ghidra github repository : [official Ghidra github link](https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra)
2. Go to releases and download zip, `unzip` it, `cd` to it, run `./ghidraRun`.
