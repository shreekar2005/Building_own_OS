# Welcome to OOSS
In this repo you will find two operating system programs. 1) baby_OOSS 2) OOSS 

Our actual goal is to develop OOSS. <br>
we are in learning phase also so there may be different versions for OOSS. Currently there are two :
1. baby_OOSS : loading bootloader in memory and then loading kernel with bootloder (with pure assembly)
2. OOSS : our main goal to work on. It's major portion will be written in C++

for more information refer to README.md from their respective folders.
