# Welcome to OOSS
In this repo you will find src code for completely new operating system called OOSS (idk what name should I give to our OS to I choose OOSS üòÅ).

Our actual goal is to develop OOSS. <br>
we are in learning phase also so there may be different versions for OOSS. Currently there are two :
1. baby_OOSS : for understanding how kernel loads in memory. In baby_OOSS we are loading bootloader in memory and then loading kernel from bootloder (with pure x86 assembly)
2. OOSS : our main goal OS to work on. It's major portion will be written in C++

for more information refer to README.md from their respective folders.
