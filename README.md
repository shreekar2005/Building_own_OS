# Welcome to Building_own_OS

## You will find detailed README in specific directory
e.g) README for OSOS is in OSOS directory, README for cross-compiler is in cross-compiler directory

## You are Strongly Requested to checkout [`./OSOS/README.md`](https://github.com/shreekar2005/Building_own_OS/tree/main/OSOS#osos) :)
## Introduction
In this repo you will find src code for completely new operating system called "OSOS" (idk what name should I give to our OS to I choose "`OSOS (Open Source Operating System)`" 😁).
I am in learning phase also so there may be subprojects like baby_OSOS, busybox_linux, etc.

### Currently this Repository is divided as follows
1.  `OSOS` : actuall OS to work on. It's major portion will be written in C++. OSOS will be 32bit OS
2.  `cross-compiler` : You will need to build cross compiler in order to build OSOS
3.  `baby_OSOS` : for understanding how kernel loads in memory. In baby_OSOS we are loading bootloader in memory and then loading kernel from bootloder (with pure x86 assembly)
4.  `busybox_linux` : minimal linux based OS, which have many bash commands also (working). This is for understand how to build linux kernel
5.  `manuals` : This directory contains the official Intel® Software Developer's Manuals (SDM), which are the definitive reference for x86 OS development.

My machine for development : `Ubuntu 24.04.2 LTS`
