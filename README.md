# Welcome to OOSS

In this repo you will find src code for completely new operating system called OOSS (idk what name should I give to our OS to I choose OOSS üòÅ).

Our actual goal is to develop OOSS. <br>
we are in learning phase also so there may be different versions for OOSS.

Currently this project is divided into many subproject as follows
1. baby_OOSS : for understanding how kernel loads in memory. In baby_OOSS we are loading bootloader in memory and then loading kernel from bootloder (with pure x86 assembly)
2. OOSS : our main goal OS to work on. It's major portion will be written in C++
3. busybox_linux : minimal linux based OS, which have many bash commands also (working)

#### You will find detailed README for subprojects if you open specific directory
