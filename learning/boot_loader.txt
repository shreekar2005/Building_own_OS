LBA : Logical Block Addressing

LBA, or Logical Block Addressing, is the modern standard for specifying the location of data on a storage device like a hard drive or SSD.

LBA treats the entire disk as a simple, linear sequence of blocks (or sectors), and each one has a unique number. LBA 0 is the very first sector, LBA 1 is the second, and so on. 

Think of it like a library. The old, complicated way to find a book might be "Building C, Floor 4, Shelf 8, Book 12." This is similar to the old CHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector) system.

LBA simplifies this entirely. (Analogy = ipv6 identifies every device uniquely -tavishi)
